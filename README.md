Waterfall Methodology
Advantages:
-Clear Structure: Provides a clear, linear structure with well-defined phases, making it easier to manage and predict project timelines.
-Documentation: Emphasizes thorough documentation, which is beneficial for projects requiring extensive planning and compliance.
-Predictability: Offers a predictable timeline and scope, as all requirements are defined upfront.
Disadvantages:
 -Rigidity: Limited flexibility once the project plan is set, making changes costly and difficult to implement.
 -Slow Feedback: Feedback opportunities are limited, as each phase must be completed before moving to the next.
 -Risk of Obsolescence: Requirements defined early in the project may become outdated by the time the project is completed.

## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
Agile is more beneficial in projects that require flexibility, continuous improvement, and high customer involvement. It is ideal for:
-Dynamic Environments: Projects with evolving requirements or high uncertainty benefit from Agile's adaptability.
-Iterative Development: Agile is suitable for projects that need continuous testing and revision based on feedback.
-Cross-Functional Teams: Agile works well with small to medium-sized, collaborative teams
->Agile is commonly used in software development, especially for projects like mobile apps or web applications where user feedback is crucial and requirements can change rapid.
Waterfall is more beneficial in projects that require a structured approach, predictability, and minimal changes. It is ideal for:
-Stable Requirements: Projects with well-defined, stable requirements benefit from Waterfall's linear structure.
-Predictable Timelines: Waterfall is suitable for projects with strict deadlines and budgets.
-Regulatory Compliance: It is often used in industries with regulatory requirements, such as government contracts or construction projects.
-> Waterfall is suitable for government projects that require strict adherence to fixed requirements and regulations.

## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
Methods for Ensuring Quality Assurance
(i)Software Quality Assurance (SQA) Techniques:
Auditing: Inspect work products to ensure adherence to standard processes13.
Code Reviews: Peer reviews to detect errors early and improve code quality4.
Static and Dynamic Analysis: Use automated tools to analyze code without execution (static) and during execution (dynamic) to identify errors and security vulnerabilities4.
Design Inspection: Evaluate software design against checklists covering requirements, interfaces, logic, and performance13.
Functional Testing: Validate system functionality without considering internal structure13.
Standardization: Implement standards to reduce ambiguity and ensure consistency13.

(ii)Testing Methodologies:
